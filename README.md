# Hourglass
A time budgeting android mobile application created at hackNJIT.
Given the constraints of a time interval and activity time, hourglass
uses our algorithm and google calendar api to return a list of free times
for that specific activity. The user may click those available times and proceed 
to create a new calendar event.
